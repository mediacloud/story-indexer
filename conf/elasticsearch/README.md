# Elasticsearch Configuration Files

By default ILM checks every 10 minutes if thereâ€™s any action to execute. In our example we had to use very small intervals (seconds, minutes), for testing.
Execute the following command to execute ILM

Test ILM policy

```yaml
{
    "name": "mediacloud-lifecycle-policy",
    "policy": {
      "phases": {
        "hot": {
          "actions": {
            "rollover": {
              "max_age": "10s"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "_meta": {
      "description": "built-in ILM policy using the hot phase with a rollover of 10s,
      "managed": true
    }
}
```

`
PUT _cluster/settings { "transient": { "indices.lifecycle.poll_interval": "15s"  } }
`
These configuration files are exported from the Elasticsearch host nodes as reference for the existing configuration.

To create a new Elasticsearch node configuration, refer to the script at `docker/elastic-deploy.sh`

### Scripts

```sh
./es-reindex-continuous.sh -e staging -s mc_search-000006 -d mc_search -f 2025-04-31T23:59:59.000Z -c
```

Run continuous re-indexing

This initiates a re-indexing task from start time (mc_reindex_from_date) and this is incremental every (reindex-interval (default:2hours))
e.g If start time is 2025-04-31T23:59:59.000Z, on the first run we re-index from 2025-04-31T23:59:59.000Z to now(e.g 2025-05-12T15:49:00.000Z)-2hours ~= 2025-05-12T13:49:00.000Z
A cron job that runs ever */re-index interval hours will execute the next task from
2025-05-12T13:49:00.000Z to 2025-05-12T15:49:00.000Z
