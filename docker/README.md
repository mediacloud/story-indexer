## Docker Swarm Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Docker: Docker must be installed on the host where you plan to set up the Swarm. You can download and install Docker from Docker's [official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package).

2. Docker Compose: Make sure you have Docker Compose installed, as it's essential for managing multi-container applications. You can install Docker Compose by following the instructions in the official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Currently runs w/ Docker v24.0, docker-compose-plugin v21.0 under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

### Swarm setup

To create a swarm

    docker swarm init

To deploy in multiple workers/nodes. Join the swarm using the command

    docker swarm join \ --token <swarm token>

## Deploying code

### Development

A single node swarm is sufficient.

With any branch OTHER than staging or prod checked out, run (as root)

    ./docker/deploy.sh

By default `deploy.sh` expects the branch to be clean (checked in)
and pushed to `origin`.  It will tag the git repository and the
Docker image with a tag like: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-HOSTNAME-BRANCH`

For easy development, a "dirty" deploy can be done with the `-a`
option, resulting in an image tag of `<USERNAME>-dirty` (and no git
tag).  *BUT* you should make sure you can run a checked-in/clean
deploy before opening a PR.

Your stack will be named <USERNAME>-indexer.

To check the health and logs of specific service within the Swarm

    docker service logs <STACK>_process_name

To list running services and container replica counts:

    docker service ls

or

    docker service ls --filter name=<STACK>_

To check that containers are not failing and being restarted,
after a few minutes check `docker ps` output.

A development deploy will fetch 5000 articles once
(no restart at midnight GMT)

To remove your stack:

    docker stack rm <STACK>

### Staging

Before deploying to production, the candidate code should be tested in staging:

To merge main to staging:

    git checkout staging; git merge main; git push upstream

Where `upstream` is `git@github.com:mediacloud/story-indexer.git`.

To avoid losing fixes, no changes should be checked in directly to the
`staging` branch: all changes should be merged to main first, and main
should be merged into staging.

And to deploy:

    ./docker/deploy.sh

The staging stack will be named `staging-indexer`.

A staging deploy will fetch 50000 articles once
(no restart at midnight GMT).

The staging stack can be removed after the batch has been completed.

Statistics from the staging stack are available in grafana.

### Production

Deployment to production should only be done after code has run cleanly
in staging.

As in staging, no changes should be made directly to the prod branch.

> *And the number of the counting shall be three.<br>
> Four shalt thou not count,<br>
> neither count thou two,<br>
> excepting that thou then proceed to three.<br>
> Five is right out.*

To merge run:

    git checkout prod; git merge staging; git push upstream

And to deploy run:

    ./docker/deploy.sh

You will be asked to confirm twice.

Since the fetcher starts new batches for yesterday after midnight GMT,
and runs for many hours, code should be deployed to the production
stack named `indexer` shortly after midnight GMT.

### deploy.sh options

```
$ ./docker/deploy.sh  -h
Usage: ./deploy.sh [options]
options:
  -a      allow-dirty; no dirty/push checks; no tags applied (for dev)
  -b      build image but do not deploy
  -B BR   dry run for specific branch BR (ie; staging or prod, for testing)
  -d      enable debug output (for template parameters)
  -h      output this help and exit
  -n      dry-run: creates docker-compose.yml but does not invoke docker (implies -a -u)
  -u      allow running as non-root user
```

## docker-compose.yml.j2 template

docker-compose.yml is generated from the Jinja2 template
docker-compose.yml.j2

Read the comments at the top of the template before opening a PR
with changes.

In particular:

Keep complexity out of the template

(Yes, Jinja2 is probably Turing complete, but try
to use it to just substitute values, and "ifdef"
parts in and out.)

Keep policy decisions in deploy.sh, and supply
values and feature-based booleans to the template

See https://github.com/mediacloud/story-indexer/issues/115
for Phil's thoughts on how a deploy.py might be nice.

## Testing changes to deploy.sh and docker-compose.yaml.j2

The following test should be run before opening a PR with changes to
deploy.sh and docker-compose.yaml.j2 to ensure all template variables
are supplied in all environments:

    ./docker/deploy.sh -B dev
    ./docker/deploy.sh -B staging
    ./docker/deploy.sh -B prod

_PLB: (maybe make this part of the pre-commit checks? how??)_
